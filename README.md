# Land Rental System

**Tech Stack & Tools:**  
Developed using **Python** with a modular design applying **Functional Programming** principles. Utilizes built-in file handling for data persistence. Project planning involved structured pseudocode and flowcharts. Developed and maintained in IDEs like **VS Code**. Documentation and diagrams were created using industry-standard tools.

## Core Features

- Simulates land parcel rentals with dedicated modules for renting, returning, and logging transactions.  
- Enforces strict input validation to handle negative or invalid inputs.  
- Manages land availability status dynamically.  
- Generates real-time rent and return receipts as text files for record-keeping.

## Program Structure

The modular codebase consists of:

- `main.py`: Handles user interaction and program flow.  
- `read.py`: Manages reading data from files.  
- `write.py`: Handles writing and updating data in files.  
- `operations.py`: Contains core logic and operations related to land rental processes.

The program is thoroughly tested through multiple scenarios to ensure robustness, accurate stock updates, and proper error handling.
